## How to contribute

If you have data on numerals of the Pacific that you would like to contribute to this dataset, you can! Please notify us of the data by opening an [issue](../../issues/). If the numeral information is already published somewhere, you can simply provide the bibliographic information for the publication. If you have a digital copy of the publication (or of the relevant pages), you can also attach that in the issue. If, however, the data are not published anywhere (e.g., they are from your personal field notes), then you can make a pdf including the data and as much metadata as possible: the name of the language, the date and location of where the data were collected, an "author" for the document (e.g., the name of the linguist who collected and compiled the data), and a title for the document (e.g., "Cardinal numerals in Language X" or "Excerpt from Dr. Linguist's fiel dnotes on Language X"). The goal is to have an "unpublished manuscript" that is nevertheless nicely citable.
